# Iris Data Model

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify the Iris dataset into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Model
The model uses a neural network built with PyTorch, leveraging an Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss (or mean squared error for regression tasks) to predict the correct species.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Purpose
The model aims to achieve high classification accuracy on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of neural networks in classifying real-world data.
